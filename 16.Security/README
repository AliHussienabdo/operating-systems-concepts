# Security

## NOTES

- Both protection and security are vital to computer systems.Security is a measure of confidence that the integrity of
  a system and its data will be preserved. Protection is the set of mechanisms that control the access of processes and users to the resources defined by a computer system.

- Security involves guarding computer resources against unauthorized access, malicious destruction or alteration, and accidental introduction of inconsistency.

- We say that a system is secure if its resources are used and accessed
as intended under all circumstances.
